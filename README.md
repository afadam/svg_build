# svg_build

Generate and manipulate lines, circles and regular polygons represented as lists of points.

Compile these points into .svg files.

svg_build, funcs, shape.py are operational files, other py files are scripts that may or may not work with current versions of above.

Might need to create /output/ directory to get it working
